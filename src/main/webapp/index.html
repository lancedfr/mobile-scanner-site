        <p>We thought on how to make the shopping experience more convenient for these shoppers.
            The first solution was to make a website with a product table and people with illnesses
            that cannot consume it. The solution however became redundant as this will take just
            as long for the user to find the product in the list.</p>

        <p>As the mobile phone has become more of a necessity then a wallet, we decided to
            come up with a scanner application that utilizes the phones camera utility. The user
            can find out if the product is harmful to him, simply by scanning the barcode.</p>

        <p>The concept of this application came to the group when we spoke about food, and
            how most people do not like shopping. Also how some illnesses like heart disease
            and diabetes causes even more inconvenience for the shopper. These illnesses means
            that the shopper will spend a few hours more in the shop just reading the ingredients
            to determine if they can consume it.</p>
